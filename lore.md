Take 1 - It's Magic, Alright?
=============================

Dunno what tone should be struck (that's a thing we should talk about
actually), but this is florid to the point of excess (doesn't have to
be, I just got on a thing):

> The warlock Hectovogrod, waxing mighty and fell in his sorcery,
> desired an abode suited to his great power.  Peering through the veils
> of time, he perceived the keeps and towers of mortal men, and saw that
> all of them fall in the end, from shakings of the Earth, or
> siegecraft, or to the slow weathering of the years.

So the dude realizes that building up is lame, but that building down is
badass and totally metal, and so makes a spell that digs the dungeon for
his crib.  But he's mad with power, and so the spell goes wrong and
makes a random collection of rooms etc, and never stops working on the
dungeon, even to this day.  Somehow or other Hectovogrod himself is
either gone or corrupted into a lich or something (end boss?), but the
spell survives.  

Adventurers can discover runestones in key locations in the dungeon that
teach them parts of the spell.  As they learn the spell, they can start
to change the layout of the dungeon in small ways (say that's how they
can start to make their own areas).

This is closer to the traditional medeival fantasy vibe of nethack.


Take 2 - Ants Marching
======================

This is more steampunk, perhaps:

The gnomes, having minds of metal and wheels, are known for their
machinery.  The biggest tribe grew so powerful and crafty in their
machinations that they forsook the ancient delving arts of their
ancestors and made machines to do it instead.  The gnomes are gone now
(maybe the machines are responsible somehow) but their old tribal
glananost survives ('glananost' is gnomish for a cave network that a
particular tribe lives in).  The machines are still there, so well-made
that they continue to dig new rooms and tunnels, but unguided by any
conscious purpose, so much of their work is haphazard and strange.
Sufficiently crafty adventurers can turn them to their own purposes,
digging new tunnels and excavating new rooms as they see fit.

This might be fun because the machines can be like pets in other MMOs,
but maybe more programmable, but it's not very much like nethack.


Regarding the Surface Town
==========================

It's weird that there'd be a town on top of this crazy and dangerous
dungeon (especially given the monsters living in it) so I was thinking
that the town is really there *because* the dungeon is there.

Maybe it's a research station or something, sponsored by the king, to
try to gather and retrieve information on the dungeon itself now that
it's been discovered.  So the player characters are basically
privateers, given a letter of marque by the king permitting them to go
in and kill things and bring back riches, provided they agree to shop at
the king's designated shops.  Sorta like the company store in a mining
town.
