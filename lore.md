Take 1 - It's Magic, Alright?
=============================

Dunno what tone should be struck, but this is florid to the point of
excess (doesn't have to be, I just got on a thing):

> The warlock Hectovogrod, waxing mighty and fell in his sorcery,
> desired an abode suited to his great power.  Peering through the veils
> of time, he perceived the keeps and towers of mortal men, and saw that
> all of them fall in the end, from shakings of the Earth, or
> siegecraft, or to the slow weathering of the years.

So the dude makes a spell that digs the dungeon for his crib, but he's
mad with power, and so the spell goes wrong and makes a random
collection of rooms etc.  Somehow or other Hectovogrod himself is either
gone or corrupted into a lich or something (end boss?), but the spell
survives.  Adventurers can discover runestones that teach them parts of
the spell.  As they learn the spell, they can start to change the layout
of the dungeon in small ways (say that's how they can start to make
their own areas).


Take 2 - Many Machines
======================

This is more steampunk, perhaps:

The gnomes, having minds of metal and wheels, are known for their
machinery.  The biggest tribe grew so powerful and crafty in their
machinations that they forsook the ancient delving arts of their
ancestors and made machines to do it instead.  The gnomes are gone now
(maybe the machines are responsible somehow) but their old tribal
glananost survives ('glananost' is gnomish for a cave network that a
particular tribe lives in).  The machines are still there, so well-made
that they continue to dig new rooms and tunnels, but unguided by any
conscious purpose, so much of their work is haphazard and strange.
Sufficiently crafty adventurers can turn them to their own purposes,
digging new tunnels and excavating new rooms as they see fit.

This might be fun because the machines can be like pets in other MMOS,
but maybe more programmable, but it's not very much like nethack.
