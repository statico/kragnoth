The Dungeons of Krag'noth
-------------------------

In development.

Run "npm install", then "coffee realm-server.coffee" in one term and
"coffee console-client.coffee" in another.


Design Notes
------------

The goal of the game would be to get to the bottom of the dungeon, get
something (say, some sort of amulet, if you will), and bring it back up
for gold and riches.

Most levels would be procedurally generated, like nethack, but not all:
Some can be designed, some can be special.  And the dungeon doesn't have
to be linear, it should have branches.

And it should change when people aren't on a certain level.

Also, I want a crafting element, where things can be smelted down into
metal and combined to form random new things.

And a trading element:

There's going to be one dungeon per game world.

There's going to be a bigger "town" on the top level, like the open-air
level where everyone starts; no monsters there.
